# Coffee-Sales-Dashboard
This project focuses on developing an Interactive Coffee Sales Dashboard that provides valuable insights into sales performance across different dimensions, including coffee types, geographic regions, and customer segments.

The dashboard is designed to track the following key performance indicators:
Total Sales by Coffee Type: This KPI allows stakeholders to monitor how different coffee types, such as Arabica, Excelsa, Liberica, and Robusta, are performing in the market. By tracking sales data over time, the dashboard helps identify trends and preferences among customers.

Sales by Country: Understanding where the coffee is selling the most is critical for strategic planning. The dashboard features a bar chart that visualizes sales data across various countries, such as the United States, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. This helps in identifying strong markets and potential areas for growth.

Top Customers: Recognizing the top customers by sales volume can guide customer relationship management efforts. The dashboard includes a chart that highlights the top five customers, enabling the sales team to focus on maintaining and expanding these crucial relationships.

The dashboard is designed with user-friendly visual elements that make data interpretation straightforward:
Sales Trends Chart: This chart visualizes sales data over time, segmented by coffee type. It helps in identifying peak sales periods and understanding the performance of each coffee variant.

Country Sales Bar Chart: A bar chart compares sales across different countries, providing a clear view of geographic performance.

Top 5 Customers Chart: This element highlights the most valuable customers, allowing the team to focus on key accounts.

The Coffee Sales Dashboard is an essential tool for monitoring and analyzing sales performance. By focusing on the right KPIs, the dashboard provides actionable insights that can drive business growth and enhance decision-making. Whether itâ€™s tracking sales trends, understanding market dynamics, or managing customer relationships, this dashboard offers a comprehensive view of the business's health and potential opportunities.
